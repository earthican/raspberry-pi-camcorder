raspberry-pi-camcorder
======================
This [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org) dedicated device was developed for the University of California, Riverside Entomology Department in order to successfully capture footage of insect eggs in remote urban and agriculture environments to look for natural predators of the Brown Marmorated Stink Bug. This repository contains four (4) modules intended for use: a camcorder to continuously record hour-long .h264 video clips (day/night) and a time-lapse camera to continuously capture still .jpg images in 10 second-long intervals (day/night).
